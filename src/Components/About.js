                    I’m a third year Computer Science major and Linguistics minor at UCLA. 
                    <br/><br/>This summer, I’ll be returning to intern at Amazon in their Seattle offices. I’ve previously interned at Amazon Music in 2022 (San Francisco), and Alexa Video (Seattle) in 2021.
                    <br/><br/>Outside of CS, I love sports and art. Some of my hobbies include: rock climbing, tennis, painting, and reading!
